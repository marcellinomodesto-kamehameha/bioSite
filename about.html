                <h3>The start</h3>
                <p> Yudonn has been present in my life for about twelve years now. I am currently 22 years old, and growing up I never called him Yudonn,
                 just his last name, Biassou, so that is how I will be referring to him. Starting off, we had a rough relationship. I would hide his work keys so he would
                be late for work, not saying hello to him when I got home, being extremely rude for no reason, the list goes on. I didn't like another man being with
                my mom other than my father. It was like this for years. As time went on, I started to realize that he was here for us, my mom, sister, and me.
                Seeing my mom struggle so long as a single mother was hard to watch, and it felt great not seeing her struggle anymore,
                she had help, and it was here to stay. </p>

                <h3>What he does for work</h3>
                <p>When I met Biassou, he was a pawn broker. He was very good at what he did. He knew how to use his words to sell something and he did it for years.
                 The company was then bought out and they let him go. He then moved to a jewelry store to go and do the same thing. Eventually he grew tired of this
                 and moved into a trade. He started working in HVAC for about three years, just to get his foot in the door. As of today, he is considered
                 a carpenter, still learning, improving, and picking up new skills every day.</p>

                <h3>His past</h3>
                <p>Biassou grew up in Miami, Florida. He played a lot of football growing up. He believes that sports can get you very
                  far in life, only because he has witnessed it first-hand. Growing up, he played football up to college level. For a while, he was
                  playing pro football in Canada. At one point, he had even tried out for the NFL as his favorite team is the Miami Dolphins. Eventually he hurt
                  himself, and had kids, so he had to focus to priorities elsewhere. Till this day, he will always find the time to talk about sports and what
                  it did for him growing up. </p>
