            <h3>The man that is Yudonn Biassou</h3>
            <p>Over the years, Biassou has done a lot for my family and I. He always had, and still has this high sense of class and the way he
               presented himself was something I never understood when I was younger. Now I am a lot older and I can only hope to reach that kind
               of level, as it encourages me every single day.</p>
            <p>On this picture to the left is a picture of him and him and my mother. Biassou is a family man. Every year, we take family pictures.
               This was 2024, and the theme was a fall/autumn color. Most families dread taking family pictures,
               including the boys in the family, but he never complains, and has always made the experience fun and wholesome for the last
               10+ years my family and I have been doing it.</p>

          <h3>Biassou's goals</h3>
          <div class="grid">
            <div>
          <p>Biassou always has high energy, whether it may be physically or mentally. Sometimes he still shows that he has more energy than
             any of his kids. That energy inspires everyone in the family. He is a very enthusiastic person, including when
             it comes to his goals, which he always tells me is for all of his children to be better than him.</p>
          <p>Biassou wants to travel all over the world with my mom. In order for that to happen, he needs to make sure all the kids under
            his roof have graduated and are able to put their foot out in the real world without him having to worry. Biassou also has a classic car
            that he has been working on for a few years. It is a 1980's chevy Caprice. He has gotten it to run a few times, but he isn't fully
            satisfied with it yet.
