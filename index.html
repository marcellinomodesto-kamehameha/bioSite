            <figcaption>Over the years, Biassou has done a lot for my family and I. He was a pawn shop manager when he first came in to my life, now he works 
                in construction. He always had, and still has this high sense of class and the way he presented himself was something I never understood 
                when I was younger. Now I am a lot older and I can only hope to reach that kind of level, as it encourages me every single day.

            <figcaption>Biassou is a family man. Above is a picture of him and him and my mother. Every year, we take family pictures. 
                        This was 2024, and the theme was a fall/autumn color. Most families dread taking family pictures, 
                        including the boys in the family, but he never complains, and has always made the experience fun and wholesome for the last 
                        10+ years my family and I have been doing it.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Biassou always has high energy, whether it may be physically oe mentally. Sometimes he still shows that he has more energy than 
                any of his kids. That energy inspires everyone in the family. He is a very enthusiastic person, including when
                it comes to his goals, which he always tells me is for all of his children to be better than him.
